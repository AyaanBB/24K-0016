Hi my name is Ayaan Shaikh

I completed my O-levels at Beaconhouse and A-levels at Highbrow College.

My interests are physical activities like football, badminton, and table tennis.

I am currently enrolled in the BS-AI program at FAST-NUCES.

Here are some pseudocodes we did in class:

a) findLargest(a, b):

if a > b:

    return a

else:

    return b
b) number % 2 == 0:

    return "Even"

else:

    return "Odd"
c) factorial(n):

if n == 0 or n == 1:

    return 1

else:

    result = 1

    for i from 2 to n:

        result = result * i

    return result
